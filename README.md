# Cave

ReTry on gravity force - like game with goal to restore crashed ship parts from thecaves with tractorbeam or rope like mechanics.

ideas so far:
  - Generated caves (maybe cellular automata + voronoi)
  - Simple physics engine with rope/tractorbeam features
  - Store to sell parts and buy upgrades for ship
  - PS4 / xbox joystick support (dualstick controls -> direction and thusters, rope/tractorbeam control)
  - Multiples caves/planets to scavenge from
